     <h2><u>3RD AUGUST</u></h2>
     <p>Baby, from the moment we started getting to know each other, you plagued my thoughts. I was always double checking my phone for your notifications, I was always waiting for Sundays so that i can feel the warmth of your embrace, I was simply drawn to you. Then the daily flashbacks of intimate moments began, I always wanted to see you, to taste you, to feel you, to just be with you. Before i met you i was really a lazy guy, but after you, cycling to your place and back was lightwork, walking aimlessly, with no destination in mind and just talking was my daydream. I loved you from long before i told you...seeing you, talking to you, always alleviated my mood, but i was scared, scared to open up, scared to love again. But time in time out you showed me how fully reciprocated love feels like, and in time all my fears dissolved, only love for you filled me. Everything in me was screaming to make you mine as soon as possible, but i wanted it to be perfect, wanted it to be deserving of such an amazing woman. And i hope i succeeded. When you said yes, and realized that you're now mine, i felt like the luckiest guy in the world. On 3rd August our beautiful journey began.</p>

     <h2><u>OUR TIME TOGETHER</u></h2>
     <P>These past months have been beyond amazing. Getting to grow this relationship with you, getting to know each other deeply, they were the best months of my life. We celebrated alot of milestones these past months, both privately and publicly, and i'm beyond eager to celebrate more with you. Baby, we've spent alot of time together, I got to know you on a level that few others have reached, i got to know all the burdens you carry, both from your past and the present, and i'll always be here to pick you up when you fall, to embrace you and tell you it's okay when you're feeling sad, i'll never leave your side baby. And ik it has not always been smooth sailing for us, we've had some turbulent times, but what i like about you, about us, is that we always navigate them together, we never give up on each other, never involve others, just you and I coming out from the other side, love filling our sails. I've never been insecure abt us, cause you earned all my trust long ago, and you reassure me whenever, no matter what it is. I trust you fully baby, always have. Writing this has made me realize how extremely fortunate I am to have you baby. You are outwordly beautiful, you're loving, you're kind, you're fully dedicated to us, passionate, faithful and so, so fucking sexy baby. You're many things, and I pray to God that my future wife is one of them. I love you so much baby, you are my world, my everything, i adore you, and the woman that you're becoming. Today is the 6th month of us, of this. And when i picture the days to come, the months, years, decades, you're always by my side baby. I can't imagine a life without you. Happy 6 months together babyy! I love you so so much, so much, you don't even know.</P>
